           Welcome to <em>Encouragement Along The Way</em>. Here you will find various devotions and resources to 
           bring encouragment just when you need it the most. Life can be a roller coaster 
           of ups and downs when dealing with not only things in your personal life but also in what's going on in the world around us. Thankfully God does not leave us to ourselves to handle it 
           alone. Check out the articles below and see what encouraging word He has 
           for you today.
